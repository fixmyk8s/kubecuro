apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: my-app-service
namespace: default
spec:
type: LoadBalancer

selector:
app: my-app
# ❌ POTENTIAL ISSUE:
# This selector may not match any Pods if the Deployment
# uses additional labels (e.g., tier: backend).
# Result: Service has no endpoints.

ports:
- name: http
protocol: TCP


  port: "80"
  # ❌ BROKEN:
  # port must be an integer, not a string.
  # Kubernetes API expects a number.

  targetPort: "8081"
  # ❌ BROKEN:
  # targetPort must be an integer (or a named port).
  # Also likely incorrect: most apps listen on 8080, not 8081.
  # Result: traffic will fail even if Service is created.

  nodePort: 28000
  # ❌ BROKEN:
  # nodePort is NOT allowed when type is LoadBalancer.
  # Even for NodePort services, valid range is 30000–32767.
  # Result: kubectl apply will fail validation.
